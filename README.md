# A simple text-based Tic Tac Toe game for 2 people

The game is quite simple, where you must enter an input from 1 to 9, symbolising the blocks counting up left to bottom right. 
Catches errors and incorrect inputs and is broken down into 3 functions.

Next on the agenda and how it will be improved:
1. Implement a CPU player, so you can play alone
   DONE: Implemented a very basic hardcoded CPU, it is not great and easily trickable. Not sure how minmax works just yet or how to implement it to a text based function.

3. Implement a GUI, for more visuals

4. Create a scoreboard
